## Personal Projects

### Kingdoms

Kingdoms is a single-player game that the player experiences. It is going to be a small RPG game with the ability for the player to craft do quests, and Manage a town.

## Built for others

### **Chatfilter**

Chatfilter I built for [https://dapperfoxstudios.com/](url) for their kinetic network. I built this when I was an admin for their servers It wasn’t requested I just got tired of people ruining the player experience for others when there was no staff online. This runs on the API spigot & sponge

### **Chatfilter**

Chatfilter I built for [https://dapperfoxstudios.com/](url) for their kinetic network. I built this when I was an admin for their servers It wasn’t requested I just got tired of people ruining the player experience for others when there was no staff online. This runs on the API spigot & sponge
